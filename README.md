# Flash-Chat

I greatly improved my knowledge in the course of the building this app. It has four screens with segues.

I learned:
1. Navigation Controller
2. Firebase Firestore and Auth
3. Table View and Table Cell
4. Custom .xib file
5. How to implement Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager in my project.
6. How to use constants file and static properties
7. Delegate Pattern, Extensions and Protocols.

This is an app I made learning iOS 13 & Swift 5 course by Angela Yu

## Description from Udemy below:

### Our Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

### What you will create

Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. We will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 

### What you will learn

* How to integrate third party libraries in your app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* How to query and sort the Firebase database.
* How to use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.
* How to create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* How to embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack.
* How to create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.
* Learn about Swift loops and create animations using loops.
* Learn about the App Lifecycle and how to use viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* How to create direct Segues for navigation.
